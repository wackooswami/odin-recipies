    <h2>ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened </li>
      <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li> 
      <li>3/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li> 
      <li>2 large eggs</li> 
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li> 
      <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li> 
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li> 
      <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol> 
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        Line your baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
      <li>Cream the butter and sugars
        In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Add eggs and vanilla
        Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract. </li>

      <li>Mix dry ingredients
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>

      <li>Combine wet and dry
        Slowly mix the dry ingredients into the butter mixture. Stir until just combined.</li>

      <li>Add the chocolate chips
        Fold in those sweet chocolate chips (and nuts if you’re feelin’ fancy).</li>

      <li>Scoop the dough
        Drop spoonfuls of dough (about 1–2 tablespoons) onto the baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart.</li>

      <li>Bake ‘em
        Bake for 9–11 minutes, or until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft.</li>

      <li>Cool & enjoy
        Let them cool on the sheet for 2–3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (or eat one warm and melty—you earned it).</li>
    </ol>
