    <h2>ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li> 
      <li>2 large eggs</li> 
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li> 
      <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
      <li>1 3/4 tsp baking powder</li> 
      <li>1/2 cup milk</li> 
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
        Grease and flour a 9-inch round or 8x8 square cake pan. </li>

      <li>Cream the butter and sugar In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Add eggs and vanilla Mix in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>Mix dry ingredients
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder.</li>
      <li>Combine everything
        Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Stir just until smooth—don't overmix!</li>
      <li>Pour into the pan Spread the batter evenly into your prepared pan.</li>
      <li>Bake it
        Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
      <li>Cool & serve Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost it up or keep it plain—your call!</li>
    </ol>
